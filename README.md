Why Cognitive Modeling?
Cognitive modeling, and specifically research into modeling using AI and statistical techniques, has increased significantly in the last 2 decades. According to the graph displayed by Proffesor Radev in lecture 1, we have seen a major rise in scholarly works related to the topic, especially journal articles. 

Cognitive modeling itself is a very interdiciplinary venture. It encapsulates parts of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science, especially the AI side of things. The integration of each field varies depending on what your final objective is, from explaining data to creating biologically plausible models.  Cognitive models themselves have many use cases. Previous research includes model-based forcasting (weather, disease spread, stock market?, etc) and attemptin to infer hidden parameters.

Cognitive modeling is also heavily used to attempt to predict human behavior in certain situations. Using models like this, we can perform more research into phsychology and cognition itself. There is a fair amount of research where we attempt to create a model that emulates the human brain. This is still a work in progress, specifically because it is difficult to scale our computer models to the size of a human brain. This relationship between cognitive modeling and cognitive science goes both ways, as we take a lot of inspiration from how the brain works, especially in areas like image recognition. While there are still certain things that the brain does that we find difficult emulate (like learning without backpropogation), overall the existance of cognitive modeling is vital to both fields.
